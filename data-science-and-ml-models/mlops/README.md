# MLOps

MLOps are a set of best practices for Businesses to deploy and run AI/ML algorithms successfully.&#x20;

It is essentially modeled on existing devops frameworks, making it DevOps with a data scientist in the team, who curates the datasets and builds the models. In addition to the data scietist there is also an ML Engineer who runs runs the datasets through the models in a disciplined and automated fashion.&#x20;

Here's how ChatGPT defines MLOps:

> MLOps, short for Machine Learning Operations, is a set of practices that aims to streamline the development, deployment, and maintenance of machine learning models. It is a multidisciplinary field that combines machine learning, software engineering, and operations management to enable organizations to scale their machine learning initiatives.
>
> MLOps involves the use of automated processes and tools to manage the entire machine learning lifecycle, from data preparation and model development to deployment and monitoring. It includes version control for machine learning models, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for automated deployment, monitoring and logging tools to track performance, and collaboration tools to facilitate communication between data scientists, software engineers, and other stakeholders.
>
> MLOps is becoming increasingly important as more and more organizations rely on machine learning to make critical business decisions. By adopting MLOps best practices, organizations can reduce the time to market for machine learning models, improve the accuracy and reliability of their predictions, and reduce the risk of errors and downtime.

Some of the main challenges that MLOps addresses are:

* Versioning - Tools like git and github can help in versioning the code that builds the model. In addition to this the data and artifacts can be versioned too to ensure reproducibility.
* Model Tracking - ML models in production can degrade over time due to change in patterns observed in data(data drift).
* Feature Engineering - Feature generation and Engineering can be automated so that Data scientist can focus on building the model, while reducing the time spent on collecting and cleaning the data.
