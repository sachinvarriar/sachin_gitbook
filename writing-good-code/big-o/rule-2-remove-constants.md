# Rule 2 - Remove Constants

In the case of a program that has a number of O(1) steps and also O(n) steps. We can ignore the O(1) the constant time functions as they make almost no significant impact on the performance of the program at scale



If the total big O of  a program is O(2n) or O(n/2) or O(n/2 + 5) all are considered as O(n)
